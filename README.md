# GoML

Go Markup Lang is a simple (not productive) DSL to build and componentize HTML structures.
It's not a full virtual DOM but, it's also don't have such complexity behind the scenes.

It's based in projects like [GiraffeViewEngine](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe.ViewEngine/tree/master) and [ElmHtml](https://github.com/elm/html). (but missing the ML sintaxe :pensive:)
